				"It’s very powerful.  Web design is pretty much all CSS.  You can do cool things like drop shadows and animations."

				"No variables.  If you use a color in many different elements, it must be entered in each rule-set.  If you change the color, it must be changed in each rule-set",
				"No inheritance or nesting.  A rule-set may logically be a subset of another and share some properties, but they exist independently of each other.  Example: columns",
				"Not modular.  Most of the time you will have one big stylesheet.",
				"No functions or control structures.  Some exceptions, for example calc().  Media queries are a form of control structure."
