				"CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets",
				"It’s a language that is used to determine how HTML elements are rendered on a screen",
				"A CSS rule-set contains a selector and a block of declarations (declaration block)",
				"The selector identifies the HTML elements subjected to the rules in the declaration block",
				"A declaration is a key-value pair consisting of a property and a property value"

				"All of your rule-sets can go in one place and be applied to many pages.  You don’t need to write new rules for each new page (you used to have to do this)",
				"CSS is very simple: basically just key-value pairs.  You can learn it in a very short period of time.  I’ve basically taught you CSS already.",
				"It’s very powerful.  Web design is pretty much all CSS.  You can do cool things like drop shadows and animations."

			"heading": "CSS is very bad",
			"bullets": [
				"No variables.  If you use a color in many different elements, it must be entered in each rule-set.  If you change the color, it must be changed in each rule-set",
				"No inheritance or nesting.  A rule-set may logically be a subset of another and share some properties, but they exist independently of each other.  Example: columns",
				"Not modular.  Most of the time you will have one big stylesheet.",
				"No functions or control structures.  Some exceptions, for example calc().  Media queries are a form of control structure."
